Sea Level Map
=============

A user-selectable map showing areas that may be covered by rising sea levels during the 21st century as a result of the effects of climate change.
Using [altitude data collected by NASA on the SRTM Space Shuttle mission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRTM) transformed to contours plotted on [OpenStreetMap](http://leafletjs.com/).

The approach is data-driven with global coverage; local approaches include [sealevel.climatecentral.org](http://sealevel.climatecentral.org/surgingseas/place/cities/LA/New_Orleans#show=cities&center=10/30.0331/-89.8826).
I noticed [this listicle](http://mashable.com/2013/04/05/climate-change-flood-american-cities/) and [worldunderwater.org](http://mashable.com/2014/05/08/sea-level-rise-visualization/) a few months ago but rapidly realised they are [visualising nonsense](http://worldunderwater.org/#/latlon/35.3605555,138.72777769999993&addr=Mt_Fuji,_Kitayama,_Fujinomiya,_Shizuoka,_Japan) that perhaps fuels dismissal of the true facts as much as it [encourages taking control of our situation](http://youtu.be/UKE1G1a1avo).

Trustworthy sources:

- By 2100 [sea level may rise between 0.5 - 1.1m](http://www.climatechange.gov.au/climate-change/adapting-climate-change/australias-coasts-and-climate-change/mapping-sea-level-rise) relative to 1990.
- [US Coastal Flooding Viewer](http://csc.noaa.gov/slr/viewer/) is both accurate and easily understood. We want to create something like this for global data.
