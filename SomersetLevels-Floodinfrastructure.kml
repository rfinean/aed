The New Bridge on Curry Moor is a rather unusual structure, in that it includes a set of sluice gates on the upstream side of the road. The bridge and sluice were constructed after 1960 and have become the tidal limit of the Tone, which was formerly tidal for another mile or so to Knapp Bridge.</div>
